# Official xAI Grok CLI — the agentic "Grok Build" TUI installed via
# `curl -fsSL https://x.ai/cli/install.sh | bash`. It is NOT the community
# superagent-ai/grok-cli that ships in nixpkgs as `grok-cli`; this is xAI's own
# tool, distributed only as a self-contained, statically-linked release binary
# (no dynamic interpreter → no autoPatchelf needed).
#
# We wrap it with --no-auto-update because the Nix store binary is read-only:
# grok's built-in self-update would fail on every launch. Updates are done
# declaratively — bump `version` below, then update `hash` (nix will print the
# expected value on a mismatch). The stable channel's current version is at
# https://storage.googleapis.com/grok-build-public-artifacts/cli/stable
