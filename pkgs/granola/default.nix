# Granola — AI meeting notepad. Upstream ships macOS and Windows only, but the
# app is Electron, so the macOS .dmg already contains the entire app (JS in
# app.asar, C++ source for its one load-bearing native module). This derivation
# does what tirtha4/Granola-for-Linux's shell script does, declaratively, and
# swaps that script's downloaded Electron prebuilt for nixpkgs' electron_42 —
# which is the whole reason this is a derivation and not a run of the script:
# the upstream prebuilt cannot execute on NixOS at all.
#
# Three non-obvious steps, all of which the app fails without:
#
#  1. app.asar's platform string is patched to report Windows. api.granola.ai
#     answers 500 to any request carrying platform=linux, sign-in included. The
#     replacement is byte-for-byte the same length because an asar header
#     records file offsets; Electron does not verify asar integrity on Linux.
#  2. better-sqlite3-multiple-ciphers is rebuilt from the C++ source inside the
#     bundle. Granola ships a *fork* carrying an updateHook() that no published
#     build has, so a stock prebuilt gets you a window that dies on
#     "r.updateHook is not a function". Only binding.gyp is missing from the
#     bundle, hence bs3Src below.
#  3. nixpkgs' electron dist is *copied* into a private dist directory whose
#     resources/ holds Granola's payload, rather than symlinked to.
#     process.resourcesPath derives from /proc/self/exe, which resolves
#     symlinks, so a symlinked executable would send the app looking for its
#     asar and icons inside nixpkgs' electron store path. Loading the payload
#     from resources/ (instead of passing it as an argv path) is also what
#     keeps app.isPackaged true, which every resource path in the app branches
#     on. Copying the whole dist rather than farming symlinks around a copied
#     binary is the cheaper of the two: it drops electron out of the runtime
#     closure instead of paying for both.
#  4. Linux system-audio capture is narrowed from Chromium's special
#     loopbackAllDevices source to the monitor of the meeting-only PipeWire sink
#     declared in modules/audio.nix. Both identifiers are 18 bytes, preserving
#     the asar offsets. The exact-one guard intentionally fails an upgrade if
#     Granola changes this code path instead of silently recording every app.
#
# Unfree, and the .dmg is Granola's proprietary build fetched from their own
# CDN. Bumping: set version + hash from
#   curl -sI https://api.granola.ai/v1/download-latest | grep -i location
# and re-check that the platform patterns below still match. Granola's own
# auto-updater cannot write to the store, so updates are declarative only.

  # The bundled fork's version. binding.gyp is the one file the app bundle
