"""Generate a Caelestia colour scheme from the Ouranos cobalt accent.

Caelestia resolves a named scheme by reading
`<cli-package>/data/schemes/<name>/<flavour>/<mode>.txt` — a flat "key value"
file of ~120 Material 3 roles. Those files ship inside the CLI package, so a
house scheme has to be generated at build time and grafted in (see
home/hyprland/caelestia.nix).

Rather than hand-mapping Base16 slots onto M3 roles, this calls Caelestia's own
`gen_scheme` — the same function behind `caelestia scheme set --name dynamic` —
with a fixed seed instead of a colour scored out of the wallpaper. That keeps
the key set exactly in step with whatever the pinned CLI expects, including the
terminal ramp, the Catppuccin-compatible aliases and the KDE roles.

M3 re-tones the seed for contrast, so `primary` comes out lighter than the seed
(#3b6bff at tone 50 becomes ~#b6c4ff at tone 80 in dark mode). The *hue* is
carried through exactly, which is what makes the result read as cobalt.

Emits `dark.txt` and `light.txt` for the package graft, plus a `scheme.json`
that home-manager seeds into ~/.local/state/caelestia so a fresh state dir
starts on Ouranos rather than the CLI's hardcoded catppuccin-mocha fallback.

Material derives every role from one seed, including `tertiary` — the
contrasting accent Caelestia puts on the clock and the distro icon. From a
cobalt seed that lands on magenta (#f5adff), which is not a colour Ouranos
owns. So tertiary is re-seeded separately: the generator runs a second time
with the tertiary seed as the source and its primary* roles are copied over
the tertiary* ones, which keeps the tone ladder M3 expects instead of pasting
one flat colour into eleven slots.
