# micro-bridge — drive the focused GUI agent app from the Work Louder Codex Micro.
#
# The Micro's bottom row is not Codex-locked, which is the whole premise. Every
# key on the board emits the same vendor HID notify; the "prompt / voice / send"
# meanings live in a lookup table inside Codex's renderer, not in the hardware.
# The bridge reads that channel, works out which app has focus, and performs the
# equivalent action there. See github.com/cartermccann/micro-herdr.
#
# Injection does not vary by machine: wtype synthesises the keystrokes and
# wlrctl activates windows, and both work on Hyprland here and on mango on
# atlas, because both compositors implement virtual-keyboard-v1 and
# foreign-toplevel-management. Only the focus signal differs, and the bridge
# abstracts that internally (Hyprland's .socket2.sock here, `mmsg watch` there).
#
# Two things this unit deliberately will NOT do:
#
#   - It refuses to start unless the Work Louder device kit is present. The kit
#     is proprietary, ships inside the Work Louder "Input" desktop app, and is
#     not redistributable, so it cannot be packaged here and has to be vendored
#     by hand. ConditionPathExists makes a missing kit a clean "condition
#     failed" rather than a restart loop.
#   - It should not run alongside micro-herdr. Note the reason, because the
#     obvious one is wrong: hidraw allows MULTIPLE concurrent readers, so two
#     daemons would not fight over the device, they would both act on every key
#     and fire each action twice. Codex desktop is the same story, and is
#     handled by the `passthrough` list in the daemon's profiles.json, which
#     makes the bridge ignore every key while Codex has focus so Codex's own
#     Micro integration owns the device. Closing Codex is not required.

  # Batch dictation, not the live streaming mode, even though live is the daily

  # because dictation picks its destination seconds after you start speaking and
  # the pointer may have drifted. Live streaming types as you talk, i.e. before
  # the latch could be applied, so it would defeat the mechanism. Point this at
  # toggle-dictation.sh if you would rather have words appear as you speak and
  # accept that they land wherever focus happens to be.
