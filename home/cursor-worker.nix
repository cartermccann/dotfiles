# Cursor self-hosted worker with computer use + desktop sharing.
#
# Cursor documents this as an Ubuntu apt line. On NixOS three of those packages
# are either named differently, built without the feature Cursor needs, or
# actively broken against a VNC X server. What the worker really probes for is a
# list of binaries, printed by `cursor-agent worker debug`.
#
# Display strategy: let Cursor create and own a single agent desktop, and make
# sure it cannot land on top of the compositor. This machine runs a Wayland
# session whose :0 is *rootless* Xwayland, which has no root window content, so
# x11grab against it captures nothing and xdotool cannot see Wayland-native
# windows. The worker must therefore never reuse :0, which means DISPLAY has to
# be unset (the graphical session pushes it into the systemd user manager) and
# the VNC server has to be kept off low display numbers - see tigervncCompat.
#
# An earlier revision pinned a separate Xvnc on :20 and passed --display. That
# worked, but --share-desktop always creates its own desktop regardless, so the
# agent typed on :20 while "Show desktop" rendered a different, empty desktop.
# One worker-owned desktop serves both.

  # home/tools.nix: that build (2026.07.23, unstable at 2026-08-31) has no

  # binaries. Move back to pkgs.cursor-cli once nixpkgs catches up.

  # nixpkgs names TigerVNC's server Xvnc; Debian ships the same binary as
  # Xtigervnc, which is the name Cursor's preflight looks for.
  #
  # This is a wrapper rather than a symlink because it is the only place we can
  # influence where Cursor puts its desktop. Cursor invokes it as
  # `Xtigervnc -displayfd N ...`, and Xvnc's -displayfd scan begins at :0 and
  # does take it, even though Hyprland holds /tmp/.X0-lock with its own live
  # pid: observed twice replacing the compositor's /tmp/.X11-unix/X0 socket,
  # which silently redirects every new X11 client on the machine into the
  # agent's private desktop. Xvnc honours an explicit display *and* still
  # writes it back on -displayfd (verified), so pick a high free one here.
  # Racy in principle between the check and the exec; in practice nothing else
  # on this machine allocates displays in :50-:99.
