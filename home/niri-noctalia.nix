  # Ouranos as a Noctalia colour scheme.
  #
  # Noctalia reads schemes from ~/.config/noctalia/colorschemes/<Name>/<Name>.json
  # (Services/Theming/ColorSchemeService.qml) and only ever reads them — it
  # writes the *selection* to settings.json and the resolved colours to
  # colors.json, never back to the scheme file. So unlike Caelestia's shell.json
  # this is a genuine read-only input and can be a store symlink. Its `find -L`
  # follows the link, so home-manager's symlink is discovered normally.
  #
  # Where Caelestia needed a Material generator to expand one seed into 120
  # roles, Noctalia wants a flat sixteen plus a terminal block — which is the
  # shape Base16 already has, so lib/palette.nix maps straight across.
  #
  # The ANSI ramp is deliberately identical to home/ghostty.nix (0=base01,
  # 7=base06, 8=base03, 15=base07) so a terminal keeps the same colours whether
  # its palette came from ghostty's own config or from a Noctalia template.
  # The "on" colours are stated per accent rather than derived. The tempting
  # rule — "the ground always contrasts with the accent, so use base00" — holds
  # for every night accent but breaks for two day ones, because base0C and
  # base08 are darkened for a light ground and then want dark text, not the
  # off-white ground. Contrast against each accent, WCAG AA wanting 4.5:1 for
  # small text and 3:1 for UI:
  #
  #             night (on=base00)   day (on=base00 / on=base05)
  #   secondary      6.52               4.83  /  3.75   → base00
  #   tertiary      10.82               3.44  /  5.26   → base05
  #   error          7.07               3.66  /  4.95   → base05
  #
  # mPrimary is the exception with no good answer: cobalt sits at tone 50, so
  # nothing clears AA against it — white is 4.44, near-black 4.41, and the
  # light-on-cobalt reading is the conventional one. Material dodges this by
  # re-toning the seed (which is why Caelestia's primary is #b6c4ff, not
  # #3b6bff); Noctalia takes the colour as given. Fine at the 3:1 UI bar it is
  # actually used at — fills, indicators, focus rings — but do not put small
  # body text on it.
