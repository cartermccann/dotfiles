# Caelestia: the Quickshell-based shell behind the "Hyprland (Caelestia)" login
# tile. It replaces waybar + swaync + fuzzel + swayosd wholesale for that
# session — bar, notifications, launcher, OSD and lock screen all come from it.
#
# Themed from lib/palette.nix, but not the way the waybar session is. Caelestia
# is Material 3 end to end: every surface, container and "on-" role comes out of
# one seed colour, so handing it a Base16 slot map would fight the system. What
# it gets instead is the Ouranos cobalt as that seed, expanded into a full M3
# role set by Caelestia's own generator (see the ouranosScheme derivation).

  # ── The Ouranos scheme ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  # Caelestia resolves a named scheme from
  # <cli-package>/data/schemes/<name>/<flavour>/<mode>.txt, which lives in the
  # store — so a house scheme is generated at build time and grafted into a
  # copy of the CLI. `caelestia scheme list` then shows it alongside the
  # bundled fourteen and the shell's own picker can select it.
  schemeName = "ouranos";
  schemeFlavour = "cobalt";

  # M3 variant, and the one real design knob here. It is baked in at build
  # time: for a file-backed scheme the CLI reads the .txt verbatim and never
  # re-runs the generator, so `caelestia scheme set --variant ...` cannot
  # change it. `content` was picked over the alternatives because it is the
  # only variant that keeps both halves of Ouranos:
  #
  #   variant     primary          background       vs. Ouranos
  #   tonalspot   #bcc5ee (C26)    #0d0e12 (C5)     accent too washed out
  #   vibrant     #94aaff (C48)    #08082f (C28)    ground is navy, not black
  #   content     #b6c4ff (C35)    #11131b (C9)     both land
  #
  # (Ouranos night: accent #3b6bff C73, ground #0a0c11 C6.) Material re-tones
  # the seed for contrast — nothing survives at tone 50 on a dark ground — so
  # `primary` is a lighter cobalt than base0D. The hue carries through exactly
  # at 274.8°, which is what makes it read as the house colour.
  schemeVariant = "content";

  # M3 wants `tertiary` to contrast with primary, and from a cobalt seed it
  # picks magenta (#f5adff). Caelestia spends that role on the clock and the
  # distro icon (modules/bar/components/{Clock,OsIcon}.qml), so those two were
  # the last pink things on the bar. Re-seeded from the palette's cyan, which
  # is still a real step away from cobalt but stays in the sky family the whole
  # scheme is named for. base0E (#a78bfa violet) is the other sane pick.
