# Ouranos — the house palette. Cobalt on near-black (night) and cobalt on
# near-white (day), named for the sky: the thing Atlas is condemned to hold up
# and the father Kronos was born to. One name that covers both machines.
#
# Colours are lifted from ~/projects/gentoo-dotfiles/themes/{cobalt,cobalt-light}
# and remapped onto Base16 slots, which is the shape this repo's consumers
# already expect.
#
# Consumed by the Hyprland session components (hyprland.lua and its waybar,
# fuzzel, swaync, hyprlock) and by home/ghostty.nix. The rest of the system
# keeps its global Stylix palette. config/nvim/colors/palette.lua mirrors these
# values by hand — update it alongside this file.
#
# NOT consumed by Caelestia: it derives its own Material scheme and owns that
# end to end, so it is deliberately left alone.
